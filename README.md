# JCyberneticMusic
J language (from JSoftware) implementation of APL code from the book:

Jaxitron. *Cybernetic Music*. Tab Books, 1985.

The book provides an introduction to APL and to some Music Theory. Unfortunately the book is needed to understand how to use this code and unfortunately it is out of print. There are used versions available at various times at the usual places you would look for a book. 

The code presented here is not a complete rendering of the code from book as it is a work in progress. Some functions have been changed to be more functional in J. Some of the functions that engage in interactive input from the user have not been implemented (as yet) as a more functional programming style is more probably more appropriate. I believe I left off somewhere around the 120s with the function 'DVLP2'.

# Installation
Everything is in one file (cybernetic.ijs). You will need a working version of J from JSoftware (https:www.jsoftware.com). Just download the file and load it into your J environment.

Please feel free to join in and update the code.
